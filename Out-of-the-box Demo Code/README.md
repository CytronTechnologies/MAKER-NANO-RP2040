# Out-Of-The-Box Demo for Cytron Maker Nano RP2040

This demo code is written in CircuitPython and it serves as an easy quality check when you first receive the board.

It plays a melody upon power up (slide power switch to ON) and shows running lights (blue LEDs) at the same time.
Then the two RGB LEDs will animate with different colors while checking push buttons' state, repeatedly.
